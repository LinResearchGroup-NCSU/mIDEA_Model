1. what about the HOH in the CPLEX?
2. Do I need to modify the parameters in phi1_list.txt?
3. training_set in evaluate_phi.py: there is only one file(native) for each complex


1. need more DNA randomization instead of prot
2. calc a new phi for experimental seq
3. use phi and gamma to calc the binding affinity
4. **find the DNA sequence and affinity(SELEX)(data)**
